      <span>
        <span class="font-semibold">Temporary, short-term or daily car insurance</span> is a fairly common and reliable way
        for drivers in the UK to get insurance for a small amount of time - generally starting from 1 hour and going to up
        to 30 days. <br />
        <br /> It is fully comprehensive, recognised by UK law, and keeps you safe when you haven't got the time to figure
        out what annual car insurance to get.</span
